\author{Author 1 and Author 2}

\begin{document}
  \maketitle

  \section{Results}

  \todo[inline]{Briefly comment the results, did the script say all your solutions were correct? \par 
   yes 

Approximately how long time does it take for the program to run on the largest input? 
717737700ns

What takes the majority of the time?}
the sorting part in the algorithim

  \section{Implementation details}

  \todo[inline]{How did you implement the solution?
using divied and conquer algorithm 

 Which data structures were used?
Vector, Arraybuffer and a Point class

Which modifications to these data structures were used?
Vector[Point]

What is the overall running time? Why?}
The overall running time is logN becuase we are doing every thing else in linear time but the sorting part is logN

  \section{Results}

  \todo[inline]{Briefly comment the results, did the script say all your solutions were correct? Approximately how long time does it take for the program to run on the largest input? What takes the majority of the time?}\par

all the solitions were correct. it took the programe 0,7s for the algorithm only, and 3.2 for the whole program (including loading the files).\\
As we can se, loading the input took the majority of the executingtime.  

  \section{Implementation details}

  \todo[inline]{How did you implement the solution? Which data structures were used? Which modifications to these data structures were used? What is the overall running time? Why?}\par

We stored the words in Nodes which has a pointer to the neighbors in the form of Array of nodes.\par 
we used a hashmap to store the words with thier indexes, and an array of nodes to store the words and its neighbors.
we have also used tuples to represent Edges, but it was a wastet of time.\\
repetable quastion??
